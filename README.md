## GNOSIS: An R Shiny app supporting cancer genomics survival analysis with cBioPortal

We have developed GNOSIS, an R Shiny App, incorporating a range of R packages enabling users 
to efficiently explore and visualise clinical and genomic data obtained from cBioPortal. GNOSIS uses an intuitive GUI and multiple tab panels supporting a range of functionalities including data upload and initial exploration, data recoding and subsetting, multiple visualisations, survival analysis, 
statistical analysis and mutation analysis, in addition to facilitating reproducible research.
